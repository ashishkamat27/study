LXC vs Docker

Docker used LXC as internal executiuon driver in previous days
but it makes dependancy for them
they write library called libcontainer by which they can access the OS
later it becomes an internal part of Docker daemon
but it is not default executor
you can fire docker daemon and tell them to use LXC.
