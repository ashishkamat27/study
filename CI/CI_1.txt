Continuous Integration

Major Problem with Developers

Hey It works on my machine!!!!

Level of Code Confidence

Does the code compile?
Doe the code pass our tests?
Does the code meet our buisiness requirements?
Does the code meet our quality bars?

CI as an Enabler

- Automatically produce build artifacts
- Easier staged deployment (DEV-TEST-PROD)
-Automated deployment

Benefits
- Code in VCS works
- Less time spent integrating
- Increased visbility of progress
- Reduced project risk
- Reduced friction within project team
- Increased autonomy of testers
- Less time spent creating and deploying builds
- Increased confidence of team and stakeholder
- Side benefit
